                I love everything about this hot yoga class. I've tried different gym and exercise, even the power plate. I finally found what's really works for me and had changed me psychically and mentally from this hot yoga

                Union Yoga rocks my world. It's the best yoga studio in the area. After two years, it feels like a second home.

                The studio offers a welcoming and friendly environment without any expectations about the practice and/or pressure to be part of the family.  One just comes to be the best that one can be that day.

            <p>
                Before I stepped into this studio, the idea of hot yoga was a bit intimidating to me. Finally, I took my first class a couple of weeks ago, and I think I'm pretty much hooked. The instructors and staff are warm and encouraging, and even though I consider myself  a beginner, I felt that my presence there was no less significant than other attendees who have been practicing for years.

                <p>We practice yoga to broaden the mind and develop the imagination. Consider the body as a house; the mind is the body’s occupant, that implicit, but most powerful, aspect of a self. The practice is a dialogue between mind and body, mediated by the breath; one’s internal atmosphere and the cosmic material that it receives, contains and uses. We practice yoga to alter our psychology by reorganizing our physiology. Yoga engages our body in a physical debate between forms that are personal, habitual, and largely unconscious, and forms that are archetypal, measured, and conscious. By reforming our body’s unconscious habits and introducing more informed and efficient patterns, yoga becomes origami for the body. As we fold and unfold, we develop dimension rather than engaging in the binary struggle between tight and loose. In this way we set up conditions for greater self-knowledge and a more expansive vision, which leads to personal change. This physical insurgence, infused with spirit, is our mission.</p>
